# ArData



All this datasets are extracted from OPUS **(Tiedemann. 2012)**. We extract more than 285.6 M unique parallel sentences (Arbic and 13 languages) from the whole collection. The set of languages is English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Bulgarian, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, and Chinese.  For each language pair we split the data into 80% for training, 10% development, and 10% test. We make these datasets available to the research community.
